## Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more. This project explores different models and compares their performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It contains information about the passengers, such as:

- PassengerId
- Pclass
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked
- Survived (target variable)

## Models Used

The following machine learning models are used in this project:

1. **Random Forest**
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. **Logistic Regression**
4. **Decision Tree**
5. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shiroirose/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git
    cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Results

The results of the models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
